#   Project
##  Strategy/Scope

Yoga Studio website aims to provide essential information about the studio and its offer to the user in a clear and visually pleasing way. It targets people who are looking for information about yoga and want to join local club or start learning yoga on-line. 
<br>

 The content is presented on scrolling page with sections dedicated to categorised informations. The <b>primary objective</b> is to find new studio members by leading them to classes booking form. With this in mind website highlights studio key points and presents yoga catagories to help users determine which is the right fit for them. <b>The secondary objective</b> is to provide on-line learning resources, giving user a choice between basic and advanced techniques.  
<br>
To achieve the strategy goals I implemented following features:
* simple website layout with a menu bar sticked to the top of the viewport for easy navigation,  
* a carusel with caption images and call-to-action buttons forwarding user to relevant sections,
* imformative "About" and "Learn" sections, 
* multiple call-to-action buttons across the whole page,  
* "Sign-in!" section with booking form providing feedback on submission,    
* consistent images across the whole page to immerse the user in Site Owner's story. 
<br>

#   User Experience (UX)

##  Color Scheme

Colour palette was selected using coolors.co generator. 
For beast readability and clean look white colour was chosen for the bacgkround, "Black Chocolate #272722" for text. I chose "Light Salmon #FF9F76" colour for hover, buttons and navigation elements to stand out and delicate "Miami Pink #FFD9EA" for sections background. "French Bistre #7A6D5B" colour was used for text in the footer. "Light Gray #D0D2D6" was used for boxes shadow effect and form input hover.

##  Typography

-   The Raleway font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback.The Raleway is a clean, modern looking font and is attractive. It is sourced from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) and it's linked to css document via @import.
